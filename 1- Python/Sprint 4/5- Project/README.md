# Heart Disease UCI - Data Analysis

## Problem Overview

The UCI repository contains dataset about heart disease with 14 attributes out of 76 , This database contains information about 303 patients suspected of having heart disease such as age , whether or not the patient is a smoker, the patients resting heart rate, sex, etc . In particular, the Cleveland database is the only one that has been used by ML researchers to .

The goal of this notebook is to use data analysis and statistical techniques to Cleane ,understand,Feature engineering and visulize features in this data and predict both the presence and severity of heart disease from the features given.

You can find the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci) or in the file in this repository named heart-disease-data.csv

# Provided Featurs  
- Provided Features
	- age
	- sex
	- chest pain type (4 values)
	- resting blood pressure
	- serum cholestoral in mg/dl
	- fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl
	- resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)
	- maximum heart rate achieved
	- oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
	- the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
	- number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
	- thal: 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect
