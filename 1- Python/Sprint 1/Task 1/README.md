  - calc_square
  - type_casting
  - to_sum
  - to_concat
  - print_max_len
  - odd_vs_even
  - to_check
  - fraction
  




2- Explain each method ..
  - ## sum_of_2numbers : 
    to get 2 numbers and retur their sum using + operation
  - ## calc_square  :
    given an integer and to return their square using ** 
  - ## type_casting :
    given an integer and to covert it in a string type by using str() built in function
  - ## to_sum : 
    given two numbers in string form and we have to convert them into integer using int() of these numbers  and the return their sum
  - ## to_concat : 
    this method is to get  two strings and then to concatenate them simply by ad + operatoion
  - ## print_max_len : 
    using len() of the given 2 strings ,  we have to find thier lenght and to print the string with the longest lenght else print both of them .
  - ## odd_vs_even :
      to determine if the given number is odd or even by using % operation . if n%2 this means that the given number is even else it's odd
  - ## to_check :
    whether it's yes or no . given a string if it's equal to "YES' or "Yes" or "yes" then print "Yes" else "No" . we will do this by  make the string in a lower case        form     to make it easier to compare
  - ## fraction :
      fraction of a number is the product from 1 , 2 ,  3, ....up to n  . Special case :: factorial of 1 or 0 if equal to 1 .
